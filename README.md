At [r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/) we're doing a dev-along following [The Complete Roguelike Tutorial](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod).

## Basic info

I'm using the [BearLibTerminal](https://bitbucket.org/cfyzium/bearlibterminal/overview) library, also known as blt. It handles the graphics and can do multiple tiles in one terminal cell as opposed to libtcod (so you can have a character tile on a terrain tile).

Basic roguelike stuff is being handled by the venerable libtcod.

## Running the game

You need to have Python 2.7.10 or higher and run **pip install bearlibterminal**. I will look into providing a bundled blt version, but that will come later.
